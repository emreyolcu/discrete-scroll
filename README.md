Fix for macOS's unnecessary scroll acceleration

## Supported versions

As of 2021, this fix works on all the recent macOS versions, specifically 10.9–11.

## Installation

You may download the binary
[here](https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll/releases/download/v0.1.1u/DiscreteScroll.zip). It
runs in the background and allows you to scroll 3 lines with each tick of the
wheel.

It needs to be run each time you boot. If you want this to be automatic you
may go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items` and add
`DiscreteScroll` to the list. If you want to undo the effect you may launch
Activity Monitor, search for `DiscreteScroll` and force it to quit.
